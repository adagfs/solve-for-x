	<h1> Our Story </h1>
	<p> Our website, The Cradle, was first conceived when I was talking to my family friend who was pregnant. We were in a zoom call when she expressed how much harder her life had become during these trying times and the loneliness she felt being cooped up at home for so long. This sentiment resonated deeply within me, as I realized I couldnâ€™t possibly understand having to go through something as strenuous as pregnancy with barely any social network or support. As a result, this platform was created to not only provide useful information for pregnant women through answering questions, providing online video resources and direct access to a professional at all times, but possibly more importantly, a sense of community which has been lacking for pregnant women in this COVID-19 pandemic. Through interactive blogs, forums and chats, I hope to create a community of mothers that will support one another, creating friendships that will last far after this pandemic has ended.
